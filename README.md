# Functional connectivity in food intake

Eating disorders and obesity form a major health problem in Western Society. To be able to provide adequate treatment and prevention, it is necessary to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the development of eating disorders and obesity. Specific brain networks have been shown to be involved in feeding behavior. 

This repository contains the linear-mixed modeling script, used to analyse the functional connectivity and amplitude of low-frequency signal fluctuations in functional connectivity data acquired during food intake.

MRI data were acquired in relation to food intake and sucrose tasting in rats. Namely, sixteen male Wistar rats, of which eight were food-restricted and eight were satiated, underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at 9.4T. Half of these animals underwent a sucrose tasting procedure followed by a second rs-fMRI scan.
